### **Known as the "Classic JavaScript Patterns"**

These original 23 Design Patterns were published in 1995 by the Gang of Four (GoF). 

Many of these are highly relevant to JavaScript, whereas others are not so.

========================================================================

This is an implementation of the Classic "Gang of Four" design patterns in JavaScript.

The body of code provided here is my playground. My intent is multi-purpose.

- First is to brush up on my JavaScript.
- Move from my core Microsoft .NET mindset to a open source Node JS one.
- As a software architect, where better to start than with the basic design patterns?
- An with that in mind I wanted to also use this code for a user group presentation.
- Plus I wanted to uplift my Bootstrap skills from Version 3 to 4.
